# WEB DEVELOPMENT

This repository showcases my web design work through two folders: "task2" and "to-do-list." Each folder encapsulates a unique web page that I have conceptualized and implemented.

## Folder task2:
```
In the "task2" folder, you'll find a web page that visually represents a layout I designed using Figma. 
This page serves as a testament to my design capabilities. 
The content within is purely illustrative, providing a glimpse into my creative process and showcasing a visually appealing layout.
```

## Folder to-do-list:
```
The "to-do-list" folder contains a fully functional to-do list web application that I designed and implemented.
The application features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to provide a dynamic and interactive task management experience. 
Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
```
#### Contents

   1. **index.html**: HTML file for the main page.
   2. **style.css**: CSS file responsible for styling the to-do list application.
   3. **script.js**: JavaScript file containing the logic for task management.

## Usage
```
Explore the web pages by navigating to the respective folders:
"task2": Visual representation of a designed layout using Figma.
"to-do-list": Fully functional to-do list web application.
```
