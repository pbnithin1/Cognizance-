# WEB DEVELOPMENT

This repository showcases my web design work through two folders: "task2" and "to-do-list." Each folder encapsulates a unique web page that I have conceptualized and implemented.

Folder: task2
In the "task2" folder, you'll find a web page that visually represents a layout I designed using Figma. 
This page serves as a testament to my design capabilities. 
The content within is purely illustrative, providing a glimpse into my creative process and showcasing a visually appealing layout.

Folder to-do-list:
1. The "to-do-list" folder contains a fully functional to-do list web application that I designed and implemented.
    2. The application features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to provide a dynamic and interactive task management experience. 
    Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
  
  Contents
  index.html: HTML file for the main page.
  style.css: CSS file responsible for styling the to-do list application.
  script.js: JavaScript file containing the logic for task management.
